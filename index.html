            <h3>Little Story About Hu tao</h3>
            <article>Hu Tao is the 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, a person vital to managing Liyue's funerary affairs.
            She does her utmost to flawlessly carry out a person's last rites and preserve the world's balance of yin and yang.
            Aside from this, she is also a talented poet whose many "masterpieces" have passed around Liyue's populace by word of mouth.
            <br><br>
            At first glance, Hu Tao appears to be a quirky and cheerful girl. No one would think that she is actually the renowned director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor unless she tells them or they are working with her.
            <br><br>
            Hu Tao enjoys pranking people and despises sitting around and doing nothing, as she wishes to live her life to the fullest. Due to her eccentric and off the wall personality, many people who interact with Hu Tao are generally left a negative impression of her, especially Qiqi, who states that Hu Tao has a "punchable face" and should be stored in the fridge.[5] On the contrary, Xiao likes her humor and finds it interesting.[6]
